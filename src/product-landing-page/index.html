            <h1>Our Philosophy </h1>
            <p>We are proud to tell you that our philosophy is one of the most controversial and picked on standpoints in
                the brewing industry. Nevertheless, we at VPB insist that:</p>
            <div id="philosophy2">
                <p><span id="jumbo">"</span><span id="mobile-quote-fix">"</span>Beer with a lot of flavor is great! But it is also very filling. When you
                    want to drink a lot of beers, at a friendly poker game for example, you should be free to do
                    that, without feeling like you just ate a Thanksgiving dinner. Additionally, many people believe that
                    what makes a beer great, is the absence of flavor.<span id="jumbo">"</span><span id="mobile-quote-fix">"</span></p>
            </div>
    
            <p>Beer brewers can choose to make lagers, or ales, or both. Many microbrewers focus on flavors. And the
                majority of small brewers produce ales. They often post blogs and rag on lagers or light beers. They
                make jokes like, "Why brew a beer like that, you can just piss in a cup and get the same thing." But on
                your next trip to the store you will see that the best selling beers are lagers. Here in Norway they
                stock pallets full of Tuborg and Carlsberg. In the US, despite all the shit talking about Bud Lite,
                Miller Lite, and Coors Light, these 3 beers occupy 65% of the shelves. Why? Because the majority of
                people just want a smooth beer that goes down easy.</p>
            <p>I love a good India Pale Ale, but what I prefer is a smooth lager. The dirty little secret, the reason
                many small brewers make ales, is that they don't have the equipment to ferment beer at 10 degrees
                celcius. At VPB, thanks to our old spare refrigerator, we can ferment lagers. And,we don't care if the
                process takes
                longer. </p>

            <h1>Who we are</h1>
            <p>Viking Pirate Brewing is a small outfit with very few employees, located on the outskirts of Oslo. We
                currently have a relatively small brewing capacity of 50 liters brewed per day. But we don't brew that
                much because our fermenting capability is much less, approximately 50 liters per 14 days. The batches
                also require another 14 days of conditioning. Our fermenting capability is limited because we ferment
                using an old refrigerator, which holds 2 large 25 liter fermenters. </p>
            <p>So each batch requires around a month before completion, but the taste is well worth the wait. We can
                ferment much more when we produce ales, around 300 liters per 17 days, but we rarely produce ales.</p>
            <p>Our staff consists of 3 employees, and 4 external consultants. All consultants work on a voluntary basis,
                because they get to constantly try out the product.</p>

            <h1>Fermenting Secrets</h1>
            <p>We have only two secrets to fermenting good beer. The first is that we scientifically deduce the precise
                amount of yeast cells needed, for the fermenting and conditiong phases to produce the optimum smooth
                beer. Many microbrewers are so scared that their beer will not ferment, they use 2 to 3 times the amount
                of yeast they need, which leads to a potpourri of possible off-flavors. We don't, we can count cells.
            </p>
    
            <p>Our other secret, which is how to speed up the fermenting process for lagers is, well, not a secret, and
                it's not our secret either. It's all over the internet, and we didn't create it. But it saves us money
                on our website because we don't have to produce our own video. Here is one example of a good technique: </p>

                    email goes to a dummy account at Free Code Camp, which most likely deletes the information before it
                    reaches their
                    server. Besides, we produce about 50 liters per month. There are 3 neighbors, who are voluntary
                    consultants, who are constantly tasting the product and monitoring it for quality. Our bioligist
                    consultant, demands a six pack of bottles, every time he counts yeast cells. And the CEO monitors
                    the quality of the product on a frequent basis, to ensure that the highest standards are met. So
                    generally there is no product left to put on the market. Even if there was, we would probably keep
                    it to ourselves because it's damn good beer.</p>
